# Installing WPILib
Follow the WPILib Docs [instructions for installing WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html#wpilib-installation-guide). When prompted to install VSCode, you may choose 'Skip and don't use VS Code', though it is recommended to install it to be used when updating 3rd party vendor dependencies.
