Welcome to the _Unofficial_ WPILib **Kotlin** Documentation! This documentation provides guides, examples, and resources for using WPILib with Kotlin for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) programming. While WPILib officially supports Java and C++, this repository demonstrates how Kotlin, with its modern and concise syntax, can be used effectively for FRC robot control and development.
